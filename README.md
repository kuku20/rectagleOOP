Create a class Rectangle that has the length and width instance variables, each of which defaults to 1. Provide methods that calculate the rectangle’s perimeter and area. It has setWidth(), setHighth(), getWidth(), and getHighth() methods for both length and width. Each set method for length and width should verify that length and width are floating-point numbers larger than 0.0 and less than 20.0. Each get method shows the values of length and width. Also, the Rectangle class has calcuatePermeter() and calculateArea() methods. Write a class “TestRectangle to test the class Rectangle. In the TestRectangle, each method of Rectangle class needs to be called with the input entered from screen and display the results.
